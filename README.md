# Meteor States and Provinces

## Usage:

* Include the countrySelect and stateSelect (optional) templates in your template:

```
<template name="form">
    {{> countrySelect}}
    {{> stateSelect}}
</template>
```

That's it! CSS is up to you.

### State/Province codes:

This package uses ISO-standard codes for states and provinces; for example, the code for California is US-CA, and the code for Queensland is AU-QLD.
